I used to like Canada and the US. But there are some things that I really don't like.

# Less Trains that I expected

I like trains. I like how they work and how efficient they are compare to cars.

From what I saw, the US and Canada have much less trains than the countries in the EU.

# Less walkable paths

There are not many pedestrian paths. The US and Canada cities are built for cars. They're not walking friendly.

# Less bicycle lanes

The US and Canada have lesser or no bicycle lanes at all. 

# I prefer to not use cars

Cars are noisy and not efficient. I'd prefer to walk, cycle and take the train instead.
