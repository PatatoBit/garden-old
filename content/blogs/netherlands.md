<h1 align="center">Here's why I want to move to the Netherlands</h1>

# Weather

Nice chill weather. That's all. And I love it.

# Bikes

I love biking. Very much. And Netherlands is pretty much everything that I need.

You can literally bike anywhere.

So many bicycle lanes. I love it.

[Their bicycles are also amazingly design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aESqrP3hfi8).


# Good European Trains

One thing that I also love are trains. They're really good. Most trains in the EU are pretty always good in my opinion. You can get around many cities with it.

# Flowers ðŸŒ·

Flowers. Yes. **BEAUTIFUL**.

# Food
I haven't tried food there yet. My asian tongue may not like it.

# Language

I can't speak Dutch.
